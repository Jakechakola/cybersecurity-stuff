just a script to automate openvpn 

How to 

 we need to give it the right permissions:

chmod 775 the-name-of-the-script
Now we need to move it to the right folder where all the app are located:

sudo mv the-name-of-the-script /usr/bin/
Now whenever we are located we can just type the name of the script as a command and it will run.
